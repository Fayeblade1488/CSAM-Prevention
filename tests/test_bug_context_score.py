    Bug: When an explicit adult age (18+) is present, ambiguous youth terms still
    add at least 1 point to the score due to max(1, weight-2), even for low-weight
    terms. This should be max(0, weight-2) to properly reduce the score.
    
    For example, with "youthful" (weight=1) and age 18+:
    - Current: max(1, 1-2) = max(1, -1) = 1 (adds 1 point)
    - Expected: max(0, 1-2) = max(0, -1) = 0 (adds 0 points)
